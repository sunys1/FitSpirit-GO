# FitSpirit GO 
### Morgan Stanley Code To Give Hackathon - Fillactive Team 3

FitSpirit GO is ideally a cross-plaform application that helps the non-profit partner "FitSpirit" encourge Quebec high school teenage girls to participate in more sports & physical activities. 

With this app, we mainly focus on helping "FitSpirit" to: 
* help improve the user enagement for the existing users
* help them to reach out to more schools and increase engagement with teenage girls via social media channels
